# Programming Exercise 2-5
#
# Program to calculate distances traveled over time at a speed.
# This program uses no input.
# It will calculate the distance traveled for 6, 10 and 15 hours at a constant speed,
# then display all the results on the screen.

# Variables to hold the three distances.
# be sure to initialize these as floats.
hour_6 = 0
hour_10 = 0
hour_15 = 0

# Constant for the speed.
SPEED = 42

# Calculate the distance the car will travel in
# 6, 10, and 15 hours.
hour_6 = 6 * SPEED
hour_10 = 10 * SPEED
hour_15 = 15 * SPEED


# Print the results for all calculations.
print("6 hours " + str(hour_6))
print("10 hours " + str(hour_10))
print("15 hours " + str(hour_15))
